John Watson performs an operation called a right circular rotation on an array of integers, . After performing one right circular rotation operation, the array is transformed from  to .

Watson performs this operation  times. To test Sherlock's ability to identify the current element at a particular position in the rotated array, Watson asks  queries, where each query consists of a single integer, , for which you must print the element at index  in the rotated array (i.e., the value of ).

# Input Format

The first line contains  space-separated integers, , , and , respectively. 
The second line contains  space-separated integers, where each integer  describes array element  (where ). 
Each of the  subsequent lines contains a single integer denoting .

Constraints

# Output Format

For each query, print the value of the element at index  of the rotated array on a new line.

# Sample Input 0

3 2 3
1 2 3
0
1
2

# Sample Output 0

2
3
1

# Explanation 0

After the first rotation, the array becomes . 
After the second (and final) rotation, the array becomes .

Let's refer to the array's final state as array . For each query, we just have to print the value of  on a new line:

, so we print  on a new line.
, so we print  on a new line.
, so we print  on a new line.
